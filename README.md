Issues
======

This is a public issue-tracking repository for bugs and confirmed features on the Stratus Network

Have a **feature request?** Post it on our [Development Subforum](https://stratus.network/forums/59b41b2b66bbaa0001000005)!

### Important:

If you find a potential exploit or vulnerability, DO NOT REPORT IT HERE:

1. Privately [contact Stratus Network administrators](mailto:networkstratus@gmail.com?subject=Important%20security%20vulnerability) about the issue.
2. **Do not** publicly disclose the issue under any circumstances.

### Do:

* Follow the [formatting guide](#formatting), and include steps to reproduce your issue
* Search the issue tracker to ensure that your issue is not a duplicate
* Be clear and concise in your description
* Use a *vanilla* environment, making sure to remove any browser extensions or client-side mods

### Do not:

* Bump issues to receive a response (all issues are acknowledged)
* Argue unproductively in an issue's comments
* Re-create an issue you feel unjustly closed
* Add comments such as :+1:, +1 or "I like this idea"
* Submit issues that are general suggestions, as opposed to *specific, technical* bugs or *confirmed* features
* Create disrespectful or inflammatory comments

## Formatting

It is recommended that issues are formatted using the following template for maximum clarity and readability:

### Title

Provide a brief summary of the issue. Your title should allow users browsing the tracker to grasp the gist of your issue at a glance.

**Example**:

> Avatars not displaying correctly in friends list

### Description

Try to separate your description into three different sections, if possible:

1. **The issue**

    This section should provide a detailed explanation of the issue.

2. **Steps to reproduce**

    If applicable, this section should provide a detailed list of steps needed to reproduce the issue.

3. **Miscellaneous information**

    Information that doesn't necessarily fit into any other sections. Common examples are attachments, images, or disclaimers.
